    CS4405 Deliverable 1

Currently we have memory management implemented, and process management partially
implemented. Neither sleep() nor exit() has been successfully finished (we have
some exit() code which does not work, and didn't get around to sleep() because we
were focused on exit).

In addition, our transition to user mode does not work for some reason - it might
be a bug in our assembly code for it. However, syscalls DO work, they're just 
currently redundant. We don't have most of the process management syscalls
implemented right now for this reason, but once we get usermode running it will
just take a few lines of code to hook them up properly.

Currently main.c shows a successful fork, demonstrates a simple example of forced
priority changes and tasks moving in the queue, along with some yielding. You can
also verify that alloc() and free() do their jobs, although we don't have that
demonstrated. To compile, just run "make". To run, use the command

    fcs-qemu-run-kernel -kernel src/kernel -bootdisk floppy.img
